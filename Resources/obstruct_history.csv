 H11302/04 -- OPR-D304-TJ-04;
AWOIS Item is not resolved. The AWOIS list makes no mention of a wreck only an
obstruction. The 2000 meter search radius was prescribed by the AWOIS list. This sheet covered the northern half of
the search radius. 200% SSS was acquired within the northern half of the search radius and no wreck or obstruction
was found. The search radius will be completed when sheet ""O"" is acquired. The ""known"" charted wreck is
disproved. There is no record of how this item got on the chart, or whether the wreck has shifted position over time.
There may be a wreck, but it is certainly not here, and if it is in the vicinity it should have been charted as a position
approximate. The Carto Code in the AWOIS list has been changed to Carto 067 to reflect an obstruction by a June 7,
2004 E-mail from HSD. To facilitate safe navigation around this complicated item add position approximate to the
wreck. This should satisfy both wreck and obstruction PA's if any are in the immediate vicinity. On 6/23/04 HSD
confirmed that AWOIS item 814 and 8225 are the same item.
Hydrographer Recommendations: Add position approximate to the wreck at the charted position. AWOIS is not resolved.
Office Notes: Do not concur. Retain as charted. Additionally, AWOIS Item #8225 and AWOIS Item #814 were the same feature. Presently, all AWOIS record entries for Item #814 have been deleted.

The radius for this AWOIS item extends outside the survey area for H11301. H11302 is the junctioning survey for this item. The DR mentions that 200% side scan was used over the northern half of the search radius. The item was
not found.
The remainder of the search radius was investigated with 100% multibeam and 200% SSS. The item was not found
in this survey (H11301) either.
Item radius was fully covered between H11302 and H11301. Delete WK PA.

investigated by divers. Divers located a wooden stucture which appears to be an ATON tower lying on its side, with
one leg standing approx. 2.81m above the seabed. Least depth by diver least depth guage was 3.81m, SWMB least
depth is 3.71m (corrected with preliminary tides).

THREE DETACHED POSITIONS WERE TAKEN ALONG THE EASTERN PERIMETER AND TWO DP'S WERE TAKEN ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIMETER OF THE FISH PENS.  THE WESTERN AND NORTHERN PERIMETERS COULD NOT BE LOCATED BECAUSE OF NUMEROUS BUOYS ALONG THESE AREAS, WHICH WERE STRUNG TOGETHER.  THESE APPEARED TO BE ANCHORS FOR ADDITIONAL PENS.

Remarks: This charted obstruction exhibits a west-projecting line along the bottom that spans approximately 144 meters. The
hydrographer believes this may be a lost titanium submarine anchor and connected anchor chain for which the U.S. Navy previously requested a search. Time-permitting, the hydrographer intends to conduct a dive on the obstruction for further identification and/or verification. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that the U.S. Navy be contacted and informed of this possible location of a lost submarine anchor.
Hydrographer Recommendations: Chart a foul line extending from the current location of the possible anchor chain to the center of the charted obstruction circle -OR- extend the boundaries of the current obstruction symbol. Use SSS imagery as a guide. Also, contact the U.S. Navy as discussed in the Remarks section.
UPDATED 1/9/2007 JCM.

DIVE RESULTS FROM 3 OCTOBER, 2006 --
Dive team composed of LaMartin, Owens, and Parker dove on this item. They report that it is not a Navy submarine anchor. It's an old Navy Stock anchor. There may be some interest that the Virginia State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) would have on this due to it's vintage, but it certainly isn't a submarine anchor. This was a visual investigation to determine if it was indeed a submarine anchor, with implications of future removal. Therefore, least depth was not determined via DLDG. 
Dive team comments: Old Anchor, iron metal w/ exposed & elevated fluke. Chain fused together on seafloor & down in the sediment. Other fluke buried in sediment.

The assigned 500m AWOIS search radius was ensonified with 200% side scan sonar coverage using a Klein 5000 and 100% multibeam coverage using a Reson 7125.
Targets in the test area should be considered temporary in nature. Targets are occasionally knocked down during exercises, and new targets are added as necessary. As a consequence, the sea floor in the prohibited area is littered
with numerous submerged obstructions (more than are currently charted), some of which may pose a hazard to navigation. Three of the targets currently charted at positions 38-13-01.08N, 076-18-48.15W, and 38-12-58.47N, 076-18-46.78W, and 38-13-00.22N, 076-18-40.91W are no longer visible above the waters surface.
The hydrographer recommends regarding the entire target area as a singular danger area and retaining the subm obstns, (See Note A) denotations and the dotted pink prohibited circle. The hydrographer further recommends tinting the prohibited circle blue and denoting it as a foul area with no charted depths.

Uncharted area of dangerous obstructions located during H11295 survey operations. Objects appear to be piles fromremains of fish traps with more piles laying on the sea floor. Items were initially located using 200% SSS and developed using a Reson 8125 multibeam echosounder. The least depth on this collection of features was found to be 22.05ft (6.72m) relative to the Chart datum. Surrounding water depths were 32.42ft (9.88m). Soundings were adjusted to the MLLW datum using verified water levels and final discrete tide zones. JCM 5 Feb 2008."

This contact (and many like it in the local area) has been identified by the USACE as an old fish stake and
determined to be not dangerous to navigation. USACE point of contact for these items is John Tavolaro
(212-264-9021).
SSS records indicate many such contacts in the area and the hydrographer feels they warrant a note on the chart.
SWMB development has obtained least depth on many such objects - some stick off the bottom as much as 17 ft.

Remarks: Feature is an unidentified obstruction imaged with KLEIN 5000 SSS and investigated with RESON 8125
MBES. The height of the obstruction is insignificant, but the nature of the material warrants a significant flag.
The type of material is difficult to determine. It is logical that the obstruction is either a piece of the pipeline, the
concrete pipeline anchors on either side of the pipeline, or one of the girders that was used to construct the
platform.

SAR: The area is supposed to be an artificial reef but there are no signs of materials being deposited here. The least depth of the feature according to the AWOIS database is 23ft but the least depth of the object detection grid is 36 ft. It seems that the materials that are described in the AWOIS text file 2640.TXT are deposited approximately 40 meters to the East of the charted location where a new area feature is included in the final feature file. The recommendation to compiler is to contact MCD for a revision of the permit limits of the artificial reef to the location and dimensions of the object obstruction to the East of the charted location. The least depth of that the Eastern obstruction feature also needs to be updated.
