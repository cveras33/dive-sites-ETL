  CL111/1919--SUNKEN ROCK REPORTED, CHAS. LORENTZEN, MASTER OF ì
THE SHIP ST. PAUL, BELONGING TO THE NORTHWESTERN FISHERIES COMPANY, ì
REPORTS THAT HIS VESSEL WHILE AT ANCHOR OFF KENAI, AK. 26 APRIL ì
1919, STRUCK A PINNACLE ROCK WITH AN ESTIMATED DEPTH OF 16FT OVER ì
IT (VESSEL DRAFT AND TIDE ARE UNKNOWN). THE FOLLOWING ì
BEARINGS WERE PROVIDED: NW CANNERY AT KENAI....NE MAG. (72 TRUE); EAST FORELAND ì
POINT....NNW 1/2 W MAG. (358-30 TRUE). POSITION GIVEN IN LAT ì
60-31-24N, LONG 151-24-30W(VALDEZ DATUM). ROCK CHARTED AS PD. THE ì
VESSEL WAS SWINGING TO FLOOD TIDE, SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN BUT ì
FAILED TO FIND OBSTRUCTION WITH THE LEAD. THE VESSEL UPON BEING ì
PUT IN DRY DOCK SHOWED THAT IT HAD SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.
  DATUM SHIFT--NAD27 SHIFT APPLIED 1947 CHART EDITION; VALDEZ ì
DATUM TO NAD27, LAT +10.7'(333.6M); LONG -27.2'(412.4M)> LAT ì
60-31-34.7N, LONG 151-24-02.8W(NAD27).
  CL1487/69--PRE. DATA OF H8789/64; INVESTIGATION OF SUNKEN ROCK ì
(PD) SHOWED NEGATIVE RESULTS. SOUNDING LINES SPACED AT 20 TO 110 ì
METERS WERE RUN IN A GRID PATTERN IN A ONE-HALF MILE STRIP. ì
HOWEVER, AS THE CONE OF THE ECHO SOUNDER SIGNAL (RAYTHEON/723) ì
WOULD COVER A WIDTH LESS THAN 15 METERS IN DEPTHS OF 7 TO 8 ì
FATHOMS, A PINNACLE ROCK COULD EASILY ESCAPE DETECTION IN THIS ì
INVESTIGATION. ROCK NOT CONSIDERED DISPROVED.
  CL611/75--FAIRWEATHER-SPECIAL ROCK INVESTIGATION(1974); FA ì
CONDUCTED A 1/2 MILE SQUARE ECHO SOUNDER INVESTIGATION ABOUT THE ì
CHARTED POSITION USING A ROSS FINELINE 5000 ECHO SOUNDER. THE 1:5000 ì
SCALE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT 50 METER LINE SPACING AND INCLUDED A CENTRAL ì
PORTION 1/4 MILE SQUARE SOUNDED AT 25 METER LINE SPACING. NO ì
INDICATION OF A SUBMERGED ROCK WAS DETERMINED. HYDROGRAPHER ì
INDICATES THAT THE 1919 GROUNDING PROBABLY OCCURRED ON THE SHOAL ì
AND ROCKS ONE MILE EAST OF THE REPORTED POSITION. HYDROGRAPHER ì
RECOMMENDS A WIRE DRAG SURVEY TO DISPROVE ROCK, BEFORE DELETING ì
FROM CHART.
  CL2133/75--DAVIDSON-SPECIAL WIRE DRAG ROCK INVESTIGATION(1975); ì
""EXCESSIVELY STRONG CURRENTS, NO SLACK WATER, MARGINALLY ADEQUATE ì
TOWING VESSELS, AND WIRE DRAG GEAR DESIGNED FOR TOWING AT LESS ì
THAN 1.5 KNOTS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WHICH RENDER A SAFE, ì
EFFICIENT INVESTIGATION IMPRACTICAL. THIS FEATURE WOULD BE BETTER ì
PROVED OR DISPROVED USING SIDE SCAN SONAR TO LOCATE THE ROCK OR ì
TO DECREASE THE SIZE OF THE AREA TO BE WIRE DRAGGED.""  ATTEMPTS ì
WERE MADE WITH STANDARD WIRE DRAG GEAR; A 1500FT DRAG, FOUR ì
INTERMEDIATE AND TWO END BUOYS WITH 300 FOOT GROUNDWIRE SECTIONS ì
BETWEEN BUOYS. THE DRAG WAS SET TO MAINTAIN A SIX FATHOM DEPTH. WITH ì
THE FOULING OF THE BUOYS, ATTRIBUTED TO STRONG CURRENTS, THE PROJECT WAS ì
ABORTED WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE PACIFIC MARINE CENTER.
  H8789/64--PATHFINDER-REVIEWED MAY 1980; ROCK INVESTIGATION NOT CONSIDERED ì
ADEQUATE TO DELETE ROCK FROM CHART. THE 1974 FAIRWEATHER ECHO SOUNDER ì
INVESTIGATION AND THE 1975 DAVIDSON WIRE DRAG INVESTIGATION WERE ì
CONSIDERED IN THIS RECOMMENDATION. (ENTERED 2/95 RWD)

 LETTER FROM THE INSTITUTE OF MARITIME HISTORY (KENSINGTON, MD) DATED 21 NOVEMBER 2005. FOUND  A PIPE OBSTRUCTION WHILE CONDUCTING AN UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF A WRECK IN THE DELAWARE RIVER WHOSE POSITION CORRESPONDS TO THIS AWOIS ITEM. THE POSITION OF THIS 30-INCH DIAMETER, QUARTER-INCH-THICK PIPE IS REPORTEDLY WITHIN 50 FT OF THE POSITION OF AWOIS ITEM 12234 (GIVEN ABOVE) AND WAS DETERMINED WITH PLAIN GPS, i.e. NOT DIFFERENTIAL GPS. THE UPPER END OF THE PIPE PROJECTS OUT TOWARDS THE SHORE AND WAS BARING THREE FEET APPROXIMATELY 16 MINUTES AFTER LOW TIDE. THE PIPE IS COMPLETELY SUBMERGED AT HIGHER TIDAL STAGES. DIVER INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE PIPE AND NO OTHER STRUCTURE WAS SEEN BENEATH THE PIPE.  ENTERED 11/29/2005 JCM.

 EMAIL FROM DAVID HOWE OF THE INSTITUTE OF MARITIME HISTORY (KENSINGTON, MD), 12/12/2005: ""JIM GORMAN OF THE POTOMAC RIVER POWER SQUADRON AND I VISITED AWOIS 13400 YESTERDAY, 10 DECEMBER 2005.  BASED ON DIAMETER AND WALL THICKNESS I THINK IT IS AN OLD WATER OR SEWER PIPE. BY WAAS GPS THE HIGH POINT OF THE PIPE IS AT 39º 34' 26.10"" N, 075º 34'38.82"" W.  THAT PUTS IT WELL OUTSIDE BULKHEAD SHOAL CHANNEL, AT A BEARING OF 278º T, 281 FEET FROM AWOIS 12234 (WHICH LIES AT 39º 34' 25.68"" N, 075º 34'35.21"" W).  I THEREFORE DOUBT THE PIPE IS RELATED TO 12234, BUT ASSUME IT JUST HAPPENED TO LODGE NEARBY. THE HIGH POINT WAS ABOUT 34 INCHES ABOVE THE WATER AT 1355 EST, 44 MINUTES AFTER A PREDICTED LOW TIDE OF -0.04 feet FEET MLLW AT REEDY POINT.  THE CURRENT ON SITE WAS STILL EBBING AT 0.1 KNOT.  WIND WAS SW AT ABOUT 5 KTS, WAVES MAYBE 2 INCHES. THE PIPE INCLINES AT ABOUT 10 DEGREES FROM THE HORIZONTAL.  IT IS ORIENTED NE-SW WITH THE HIGH POINT AT THE SW END, TOWARD SHORE AT DUTCH NECK.  IT IS FULL OF MUD, LIGHTLY ENCRUSTED WITH BARNACLES, AND CORRODED RIGHT THROUGH IN A FEW PLACES.  WE DID NOT MEASURE THE WATER DEPTH ALONGSIDE IT."" CL 1553/05 reports the same information.

 H11302/04 -- OPR-D304-TJ-04;
AWOIS Item is not resolved. The AWOIS list makes no mention of a wreck only an
obstruction. The 2000 meter search radius was prescribed by the AWOIS list. This sheet covered the northern half of
the search radius. 200% SSS was acquired within the northern half of the search radius and no wreck or obstruction
was found. The search radius will be completed when sheet ""O"" is acquired. The ""known"" charted wreck is
disproved. There is no record of how this item got on the chart, or whether the wreck has shifted position over time.
There may be a wreck, but it is certainly not here, and if it is in the vicinity it should have been charted as a position
approximate. The Carto Code in the AWOIS list has been changed to Carto 067 to reflect an obstruction by a June 7,
2004 E-mail from HSD. To facilitate safe navigation around this complicated item add position approximate to the
wreck. This should satisfy both wreck and obstruction PA's if any are in the immediate vicinity. On 6/23/04 HSD
confirmed that AWOIS item 814 and 8225 are the same item.
Hydrographer Recommendations: Add position approximate to the wreck at the charted position. AWOIS is not resolved.
Office Notes: Do not concur. Retain as charted. Additionally, AWOIS Item #8225 and AWOIS Item #814 were the same feature. Presently, all AWOIS record entries for Item #814 have been deleted.

The radius for this AWOIS item extends outside the survey area for H11301. H11302 is the junctioning survey for this item. The DR mentions that 200% side scan was used over the northern half of the search radius. The item was
not found.
The remainder of the search radius was investigated with 100% multibeam and 200% SSS. The item was not found
in this survey (H11301) either.
Item radius was fully covered between H11302 and H11301. Delete WK PA.

Target 6 - 26:03.956 N, 080:05.617W - 36-inch steel plate sphere

All buoys are white with orange markings, have approximately 1500 lbs of reserve buoyancy, and are moored to 4000 lb concrete block and chain risers.  The memo indicates that the buoys are in a north/south line in 35-feet of water and are suspended off the bottom with 15-feet of chain.  The targets were installed for use by Florida Atlantic University and the South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility and according to the CL should be considered permanent.

Remarks: This charted obstruction exhibits a west-projecting line along the bottom that spans approximately 144 meters. The
hydrographer believes this may be a lost titanium submarine anchor and connected anchor chain for which the U.S. Navy previously requested a search. Time-permitting, the hydrographer intends to conduct a dive on the obstruction for further identification and/or verification. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that the U.S. Navy be contacted and informed of this possible location of a lost submarine anchor.
Hydrographer Recommendations: Chart a foul line extending from the current location of the possible anchor chain to the center of the charted obstruction circle -OR- extend the boundaries of the current obstruction symbol. Use SSS imagery as a guide. Also, contact the U.S. Navy as discussed in the Remarks section.
UPDATED 1/9/2007 JCM.

DIVE RESULTS FROM 3 OCTOBER, 2006 --
Dive team composed of LaMartin, Owens, and Parker dove on this item. They report that it is not a Navy submarine anchor. It's an old Navy Stock anchor. There may be some interest that the Virginia State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) would have on this due to it's vintage, but it certainly isn't a submarine anchor. This was a visual investigation to determine if it was indeed a submarine anchor, with implications of future removal. Therefore, least depth was not determined via DLDG. 
Dive team comments: Old Anchor, iron metal w/ exposed & elevated fluke. Chain fused together on seafloor & down in the sediment. Other fluke buried in sediment.

The assigned 500m AWOIS search radius was ensonified with 200% side scan sonar coverage using a Klein 5000 and 100% multibeam coverage using a Reson 7125.
Targets in the test area should be considered temporary in nature. Targets are occasionally knocked down during exercises, and new targets are added as necessary. As a consequence, the sea floor in the prohibited area is littered
with numerous submerged obstructions (more than are currently charted), some of which may pose a hazard to navigation. Three of the targets currently charted at positions 38-13-01.08N, 076-18-48.15W, and 38-12-58.47N, 076-18-46.78W, and 38-13-00.22N, 076-18-40.91W are no longer visible above the waters surface.
The hydrographer recommends regarding the entire target area as a singular danger area and retaining the subm obstns, (See Note A) denotations and the dotted pink prohibited circle. The hydrographer further recommends tinting the prohibited circle blue and denoting it as a foul area with no charted depths. Finally, the hydrographer recommends removing all currently charted obstructions within the prohibited area.  (Updated CEH 6/2011)"

Remarks:
The group of features are SSS contacts of the concrete pipe anchors used to anchor the charted pipeline servicing
the TOSCO Riverhead platform. The pipeline was imaged with KLEIN 5000 SSS and extensive RESON MBES
was acquired over the pipeline as well (exceeding the suggested 100m buffer around the AWOIS item). The
concrete pipe anchors are clearly evident in the bathymetry as well as in the SSS. The positioning of the pipeline
on Chart 12354 closely agrees with the digital data acquired in the field. Updated 3/9/2007 JCM."

Remarks:
This contact (and many like it in the local area) has been identified by the USACE as an old fish stake and
determined to be not dangerous to navigation. USACE point of contact for these items is John Tavolaro
(212-264-9021).
SSS records indicate many such contacts in the area and the hydrographer feels they warrant a note on the chart.
SWMB development has obtained least depth on many such objects - some stick off the bottom as much as 17 ft.

H12488/2014 - OPR-B340-TJ-12 -
SAR: The area is supposed to be an artificial reef but there are no signs of materials being deposited here. The least depth of the feature according to the AWOIS database is 23ft but the least depth of the object detection grid is 36 ft. It seems that the materials that are described in the AWOIS text file 2640.TXT are deposited approximately 40 meters to the East of the charted location where a new area feature is included in the final feature file. The recommendation to compiler is to contact MCD for a revision of the permit limits of the artificial reef to the location and dimensions of the object obstruction to the East of the charted location. The least depth of that the Eastern obstruction feature also needs to be updated.
Compile: Retain Obstruction Area.

Investigation Summary: This assigned item was listed as submerged rocks with a search radius of 200 meters. The area was covered by Klein Sonar at 75 meter range scale with100% & 200% coverage. Submerged rocks were found in the search area and SWMB was used to obtain depths on the rocks in the search area. Rocks with least depths of 10.55 meters were found within the search radius. Search radius was not fully investigated with SSS. Position on least depth of rocks was not documented. 
Recommendations: The hydrographer recommends that the assigned AWOIS item remain as charted.
Concur w/ clarification, AWOIS#5845 was charted for the purpose of bringing mariner¿s attention to the Submerged jetty in the vicinity. Based on correspondence with Operations Branch on 05/12/04, it is recommended that Obstn PA be moved to the northern extent of multibeam coverage in Brazos Santiago Pass.
